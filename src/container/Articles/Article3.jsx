              on the wall by the kids of our project. When we first moved into the place, 
              the walls had the original cement colour lacking warmth to the space. 
              After consultation with the kids, we decided to make the walls more playful and fun."

              They shared the paints and brushes among themselves giving everyone a chance to participate. 
              The wall has come out naturally and showcases the diversity of the childrenâ€™s minds, 
              as they come from different backgrounds and upbringings. 
              These different backgrounds results in different personalities."

              As your eyes continue reading the wall, you will spot many hand-prints made by the kids using paint. 
              I believe this is to remind us that we all deserve a high five. We are all loved and appreciated just the way we are."

              learn and play. One of our kids, Shadrack Odongo aka Babji tells of his experience after painting the wall. 
              He says he got a chance to tell others about himself and was able to make new friends."
